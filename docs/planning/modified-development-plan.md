# Modified DPOP Development Plan
## Supporting Party and Movement Operations

### Phase 0: Project Setup & Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)
*Core modifications to support dual architecture from the start*

#### Extended Repository Structure

    ├── movement/        # Movement-specific tests
    └── shared/          # Shared functionality tests
```

#### Database Schema Extensions
```typescript
// Additional Prisma schema definitions
model Organization {
  id          String   @id
  type        String   // 'party' | 'movement' | 'hybrid'
  name        String
  config      Json
  features    Json
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Member {
  id          String   @id
  orgId       String
  type        String[] // Can be ['party'], ['movement'], or ['party', 'movement']
  profile     Json
  stage       String?  // For movement members: 'egg' | 'larvae' | 'pupa' | 'butterfly'
  roles       Json
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 4-7)

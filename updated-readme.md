# DPOP (Digital Party Operations Platform)

DPOP is a decentralized platform designed to support both political parties and social movements, enabling effective democratic operations in both online and offline environments. Initially developed for Unity Forward (Enhet Fram√•t) in Sweden, but designed to be universally applicable.

## Core Concepts

- **Dual Support**: Integrated support for both structured party operations and fluid movement activities
- **Natural Growth**: Inspired by butterfly metamorphosis stages for participant development
- **Inclusive Design**: Universal accessibility without special adaptations for different groups
- **Hybrid Operations**: Seamless integration of digital and physical activities

## Features (Planned)

### Shared Infrastructure
- Decentralized, P2P-based platform
- Secure member management and communication
- Document management with offline support
- Event coordination and resource management

### Party-Specific Features
- Formal decision-making tools
- Committee management
- Campaign coordination
- Policy development support

### Movement-Specific Features
- Fluid participation support
- "Meadow" gathering coordination
- Initiative management
- Resource sharing platform

## Current Status

Early development - establishing core infrastructure and implementing initial features for both party and movement operations.
